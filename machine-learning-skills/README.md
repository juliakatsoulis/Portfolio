# Machine Learning Skills

This folder contains projects in clustering, optimization, and binary classification. My work highlights both the mathematical foundations and the practical implementation of algorithms, with a focus on interpretability and performance evaluation.

1. binary_classification.ipynb:

Here, I built and compared Logistic Regression and Linear SVM models in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (binary 0 vs 1 task). By experimenting with optimization strategies (SGD, Momentum, different learning rates), I achieved ~99.9% accuracy while demonstrating how hyperparameters affect model convergence and stability. This project showcases my skills in machine learning model development, optimization, and performance evaluation using real-world datasets.
