# Machine Learning Skills

This folder contains projects in clustering, optimization, and binary classification. My work highlights both the mathematical foundations and the practical implementation of algorithms, with a focus on interpretability and performance evaluation.

binary_classification.ipynb:

I built and compared Logistic Regression and Linear SVM models in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (binary 0 vs 1 task). By experimenting with optimization strategies (SGD, Momentum, different learning rates), I achieved ~99.9% accuracy while demonstrating how hyperparameters affect model convergence and stability. 

optimization.ipynb:

I implemented and compared gradient descent optimization methods to minimize complex functions and train logistic regression models. By experimenting with different learning rates, momentum, and backtracking line search, I showed how optimization choices affect convergence speed, stability, and accuracy. I also applied these methods on real datasets to demonstrate scalability.
